# Market-Research

Automated multi-agent framework for performing structured market & competitor research.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

**Market-Research** is a system designed to coordinate autonomous agents to perform end-to-end market and competitor intelligence tasks. The goal is to streamline what is normally a manual, labor-intensive research process:

- Discover competitors and related firms  
- Scrape relevant data (websites, news, social media)  
- Analyze and compare features, pricing, sentiment, strengths/weaknesses  
- Synthesize findings into a coherent report  

This repository houses the orchestration logic, agent modules, and the pipeline from raw data to human-readable output.
